SimpleTimer allows you to:\r\n\r\n1. Create autostarting or non-autostarting timers.\r\n2. Have a timer that runs only once.\r\n3. Start, pause, stop your timer on the fly\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\nYou can [download the files](https://github.com/JoshStrobl/SimpleTimer/zipball/master), run the test(s), etc.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nSimpleTimer is licensed under the Apache v2 License.\r\n\r\n## How can I help?\r\n\r\n### Buy me a beer\r\n\r\nBeer in Finland isn't really cheap. No really, the Finnish government has a rather high tax on alcohol. Want features? (*not really sure what...but I welcome ideas*) Feel free to buy me a beer. You can use [Gumroad](https://gum.co/upeo) to pitch in a couple dollars. You won't really get anything special in return, except my thanks.\r\n\r\n### Other ways\r\n\r\nFile bug reports, post a discussion, share it on social networks. You can add me on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+JoshuaStrobl) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoshStrobl).\r\n\r\n## Using SimpleTimer\r\n\r\nThe following options are available when defining / creating a timer:\r\n```\r\n\"action\" : Function (required) - The function that is executed per timer tick\r\n\"autostart\" Boolean (not required, defaults to false) - Whether to autostart the timer or not\r\n\"duration\" : Number (required) - The delay per tick in milliseconds\r\n\"once\" : Boolean (not required, defaults to false) - Run the timer once\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Timer construction:\r\n```\r\nvar iLikeBacon = new SimpleTimer(\r\n    {\r\n        \"action\" : function(){\r\n            console.log(\"I like bacon!\");\r\n        },\r\n        \"autostart\" : true,\r\n        \"duration\" : 5000\r\n    }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the timer above, we are executing an action every 5 seconds (5000ms) on a new SimpleTimer that has autostarted.\r\n\r\n### Properties\r\n\r\nOnly one property so far:\r\n```\r\ntimerActive : Boolean - Is the timer active\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\n```\r\nstart() - Start the timer\r\npause() - Pause the timer\r\nrestart() - Restart the timer\r\nstop() - Stop the timer\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
